Introduction
============
Shoelace theme with a light feel through colour and font selection.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle version 2012120303.10 release 2.4.3+ (Build: 20130425) and above until the next release.

You must have the Bootstrap theme installed from which this theme depends.
Available from https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_bootstrap

NOTE: This is a pre-release Moodle 2.4 Beta version that must NOT be used on production servers.  It is subject to change
at any time without notice.

Installation

 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Ensure that you have the Bootstrap theme installed in '/theme/bootstrap', otherwise download from
    https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_bootstrap then install.
 3. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.

 6. Select as the theme for the site.

 3. Make a backup of your old 'shoelace' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.

Reporting Issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke
customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. 

When reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')
or contact me direct (details at the bottom).

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's 
version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.
